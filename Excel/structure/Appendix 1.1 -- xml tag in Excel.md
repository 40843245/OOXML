# Appendix 1.1 -- xml tag in Excel
## Prequisite
To have a better understanding of a list of tags in OOXML, it's better to be familiar with these basic knowledgement or concepts before looking at these articles.

+ concept of layout, style, headings etc that will be used in a Document.
+ commonly used terms. (Some advanced terms can be reviewed at this article -- `Prequisite Review 1 -- terms`[^1] )
+ commonly used tags (and theire attributes) in native html5 and native xml.
+ concepts of namespace, class in OO (Object-Oriented) design pattern.
+ concepts of `Part and Relationship in OOXML`[^4].

## Suggestion
Here is my suggestion to reader.

**NEVER cram these tags in OOXML into your brain (死記，沒理解就硬塞東西)**. Otherwise, you may got stuck on this.

Just understand these commonly used tags in OOXML then remember (理解在記住) it.

For those uncommonly used tags and attribute, **search it when you need it**. 

After all, it only lists some tags and its attribute in OOXML. 

It's like a dictionary, search it when you want to know a vocabulary.
