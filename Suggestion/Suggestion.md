# Suggestion
Here is my suggestion to reader.

**NEVER cram these tags in OOXML into your brain (死記，沒理解就硬塞東西)**. Otherwise, you may got stuck on this.

Just understand these commonly used tags in OOXML then remember (理解在記住) it.

For those uncommonly used tags and attribute, **search it when you need it**. 

After all, it only lists some tags and its attribute in OOXML. 

It's like a dictionary, search it when you want to know a vocabulary.
